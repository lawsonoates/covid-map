# Covid Map
Ever since late 2019 when SARS-CoV-2 started to spread, the need for COVID-19 data has grown. This map is designed to give insight into the later stages of the pandemic where vaccination rates are increasing and people seek to travel. This map aims to give you insights into the risk profile of different countries to give people the best opportunity to avoid contracting SARS-CoV-2.

## Motivation
I was bored. Just prior to my term break I learnt Python and I had developed previous experience with React by self-learning. So I decided to give myself a challenge over the holidays to produce something functionally relevant and useful.

## Tech used
### Frontend
- React
- styled components
- React Vector Maps

### Backend
- Flask
